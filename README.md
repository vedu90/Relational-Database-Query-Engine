# Relational-Database-Query-Engine
• The project is aimed at developing a relational database SQL Interpreter and query parser,given a set of tables as files containing records, we had to develop a functionality using JSQLParser to evaluate the results of standard SQL statements.
• For External Memory Queries, we implemented Sort-Merge Join, K- way Merge Sort to support the operations of join and selection with limited heap memory and large dataset size to run standard TPCH queries.
• For InMemory Queries, we implemented One-pass Hash Join and Hash Indexes to support the operations of join and selection with enough heap memory and large dataset size to run standard TPCH queries.
